# Softare_Defined_Networks_Project_2023_24

## Project Overview
This project is the final test for the "Software Defined Networks" course in the "Engineering of Computing Systems" program at Politecnico di Milano (2023/24). The goal of this project is to calculate the link delays between switches in a network using a Ryu controller.

## Features
- Works on any topology with at least two interconnected switches, regardless of the number of clients and servers.
- Dynamically adapts to new network configurations.
- Designed for continuously evolving networks, where switches can be connected or disconnected without affecting delay measurements.
- Computes link delays based on the current network topology and traffic conditions.

## Technologies Used
- **Ryu SDN Controller**: A component-based software-defined networking framework.
- **Mininet**: A network emulator for creating and testing SDN environments.
- **Python**: The programming language used to implement the controller logic.

## Disclaimer
This project is for academic purposes only and is not intended for external testing or deployment.

## Authors
This project was developed as part of the "Software Defined Networks" course at Politecnico di Milano.
